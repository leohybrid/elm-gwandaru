Welcome to my creative world.

I’m Elm Gwandaru, a poet, an artist, a writer and a restless soul translating chaos into rhythm.

This space is more than a gallery of words and images; it is a living archive of rebellion, reflection, and ritual.

Here you’ll find poems that burn like incense and sting like smoke,

artwork that bends reality into myth, and fragments of thought stitched together with humor, sorrow, and fire.



I write to wrestle with silence, to carve beauty out of contradiction,

to leave ink-stains where history forgot to write.

Every piece here is a pulse, a fragment of my spirit,

an invitation to wander with me through alleyways of philosophy and dreamscapes of satire.



So step inside... 

no shoes, 

no masks, 

no rules.

This isn’t just a website.

It’s a mirror, a sanctuary, and a battlefield.

It’s my way of saying: the world is absurd, but art makes it survivable.
