**(A darkly humorous, philosophical takedown of the power machine, soaked in metaphor, madness, and ancient truths)**

They say to live long on Earth, you must shrink. Make yourself small enough to disappear under the radar of power. Bow beneath suspicion. Duck questions. Mute your curiosity. Walk the narrow path they carved for you and call it ambition. Know your lane, stay in it, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll survive long enough to buy yourself a plot six feet under.

Let’s not romanticize it, this isn’t a world. It’s a slaughterhouse disguised as a theater. A play written by a few, acted by many, and funded by your unpaid overtime. Here, the spotlight shines on the chosen, and the rest of us, well, we clap. We’re the crowd. The filler. The blurry background in someone else’s success story.

Welcome to the Minority Club. Membership: inherited. Doors: reinforced. Secrets: ancient. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s worse. It’s a culture. A tradition. A legacy passed down like a virus between trust funds and yachts. They don’t want your vote. They already own the ballot box. You, my friend, were born into the wrong cast of this rigged opera.

And what of the rest? We are the majority. The sacrificed. The tested. The ignored. There are no bunkers for us, no clean air, no safety net. We are the ones who make the gears turn and get crushed by them. And every time we raise our voices, the system reminds us: you are replaceable. You are recyclable. You are disposable.

We lie. That’s our pastime now. We lie to survive, to impress, to escape, to sell. We lie on our resumes and in our relationships. The worst part? The ones who cry the loudest when lied to are usually the biggest liars themselves. That’s the sick joke of it all. We’ve turned survival into performance. Authenticity is now a marketing strategy.

Where once stood villages, now stand skyscrapers of isolation. Where we once burned firewood, we now burn out. Our ancestors must be somersaulting in their graves, screaming in languages we’ve forgotten how to translate. They gave us drumbeats. We gave them TikTok dances and call centers.

We are addicted to comparison. We don’t want equality. We want a footstool. Someone below us. Someone to feel better than. We want to matter by making someone else smaller. Every man wants to be king. Every woman wants a castle. And every child is born into the war of expectations. So we build roles. Labels. Titles. Hierarchies. We call them order, but they are just the acceptable face of domination.

The metaphors keep coming. "Top of the class," "Head of the house," "CEO of your life." You see the pattern? Every structure needs a loser. And we wear these titles like crowns, not realizing they are made from the bones of the crushed.

We kill for gods we’ve never seen. We indoctrinate kids into systems of belief older than their bones, not because they are true, but because we fear freedom. Religion, politics, culture are but elaborate uniforms we force on young minds before they can ask, “Why?” No one wants truth. They want certainty. Comfort. The illusion of control.

Now imagine Plato’s cave, but make it 2025. The shadows are backlit by Netflix. The fire is sponsored by Coca-Cola. The chains? Wireless. We no longer need iron, just infinite scroll. The prisoners now laugh at the sun. The one who escapes is called a madman. And if you dare return to wake the others, they’ll block you, report you, or turn you into a meme. Enlightenment doesn’t trend. Or cancel your shit.

And Diogenes? That mad bastard. He lived in a barrel, pissed in public, mocked emperors, and told Alexander the Great to get the fuck out of his sunlight. That was his philosophy: freedom through detachment. Minimalism weaponized into rebellion. Diogenes wouldn’t be verified on X. He’d be shadowbanned. Flagged. Diagnosed. Today, we fear the barrel. We want mortgages. We want subscription packages for comfort. But the man in the barrel might be freer than you’ll ever be.

Now let’s summon the ghosts of greed. The old gods of industry. Vanderbilt. Rockefeller. Carnegie. They didn’t build America, they built its cage. Vanderbilt strangled the railway and monopolized movement. Rockefeller milked the Earth and sold it back as oil-soaked destiny. Carnegie read gospel and still crushed unions. These men were not builders. They were siphons. They sucked the planet dry and sold us the desert.

They didn’t just invent capitalism, they injected it into our DNA. A system built not on production, but on perpetual scarcity. Where value is created by limiting access, not expanding it. They told us competition makes us better. But it only makes us bitter. Look around, everyone’s hustling, no one’s healing.

So yes, Elon says maybe Earth is the only dot in the cosmos with life. And we must expand it. Colonize Mars. Build outposts in the sky. But I ask, why? Why take our poison to another planet before we detox here? Before we say no one dies from hunger, thirst, war, or boredom. Before we build not rockets, but communities.

But here’s the twist, life is not black and white. There are no pure lands. No final answers. Even your utopia casts a shadow. And freedom is not the absence of laws, but the presence of shared truth. So let the criminals have their badlands. Let the empires collapse into their own debt. But don’t expect angels to fly in. Build your own cathedral from the broken bricks they left behind.

Every day, we wake up closer to death. Some through old age. Most through stress, pollution, and debt. We are dying at the speed of 5G and processed sugar. And Big Pharma? They don’t cure. They maintain. Illness is profitable. Wellness is disruptive. They don’t want you healed. They want you hooked.

Still, I won’t say don’t get rich. Get rich. Burn your name into gold if you must. but try help someone. Even once. Because maybe, just maybe, this whole circus folds in the end. The curtain drops. The lights fade. And in that silence, what echoes won’t be your net worth or your influencer rank. It’ll be how many people breathed easier because you existed.

The Minority Club will always exist. But maybe, if enough of us walk away from their banquet of illusions, we can make a new table. A messy table. With cracked cups. And no head.

But maybe, just maybe, it’ll be a place worth eating at.

So yeah, I wrote this to make a dollar or two. But if you read this far, know this: my madness isn't for sale.
