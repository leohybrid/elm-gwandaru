If the poles decide to shift under my watch—
let them.
The universe knew its glory
was to be witnessed
by these weary eyes,
red-veined, half-drunk on memory.

I did not come to whisper.
I came to roar in quiet rooms,
to laugh when it hurt,
to light a joint on the edge of grief,
and inhale the absurdity of it all.

I danced in shoes that didn’t fit
and ran through cities that never loved me back.
But I still looked good doing it—
like a mad poet in a courtroom,
arguing with God
over unpaid karma.

Let the stars collapse into themselves.
Let nations burn digital flags.
Let exes text weird things
about fridges I don’t need.

I was here.
And not one second of it
was refundable.
