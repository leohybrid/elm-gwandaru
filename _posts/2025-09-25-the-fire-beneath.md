Human beings—and all things conscious, with purpose—are layered like the Earth.
To marvel at the lush trees, the deep oceans, and the celestial silence above,
you must understand this:
deep beneath, a fire burns.

A core aflame.
The yang to all this outer yin.
That inner blaze?
It’s not chaos—it’s blueprint.
It’s your birthright, your compass.
The molten reason your world keeps spinning.

Sometimes, it escapes—
like magma through grief, like oil through genius—
a volcanic outburst of soul.
Other times, it hums silently, powering the unseen.

Above, comets crash—
problems, heartbreaks, betrayals—
some extinguish what was once radiant,
others leave you cracked, half-alive,
and still…
you rotate.

You are not just surface.
You are mantle.
You are heat.

Most forget their fire—
and when life scorches from the outside,
they scream, “This is destruction.”
But listen:
sometimes pain is divine combustion.

Forests fall within you,
only to become homes for those who depend on your wood.
Your rivers flood with sorrow,
yet tears carry minerals too.

Are you an oasis or a wasteland?
A gold mine or a ghost town?
Do you store oil or salt?
You are both mirror and miner.
What you hide is what you are.

And that fire—it never asked for permission to exist.
It simply was.

So burn, human.
Burn like the old mother Earth.
Before your ember flickers out,
embrace the sun, dance beneath the moon,
let stardust remind you:
your rotation is sacred.

Every extinction leads to a renaissance.
Your layers are not weakness—they are myth.

You are not like the Earth.
You are the Earth.
The spark.
The shell.
The storm.
The silence.
