description: "A meditation on the quiet violence of narrative control, manufactured consent, and the engineering of modern consciousness."
---

There is a quieter violence than war, subtler than famine, and far more efficient than chains. It does not bruise the body. It pacifies the mind. It convinces a human being that what they are seeing is all there is, and that what they are told is safer than what they think. This is the violence of our age, and it wears the costume of normalcy.

We are not ruled anymore—we are *managed*. Curated. Soft-handled into compliance by narratives so repetitive they become invisible. Power no longer needs to threaten; it simply narrates. It narrates until resistance feels eccentric, until questioning feels antisocial, until doubt itself is framed as a moral failure.

The modern world is not built on lies alone, it is built on **permission**. Permission to speak. Permission to notice. Permission to remember. And most people, exhausted and hungry and overstimulated, accept the terms without reading the contract.

This is how absurdities survive in plain sight.

A leader is declared "great" not because of outcomes, but because repetition has weight. Say a thing often enough, broadcast it loud enough, outsource it to enough mouths, and it begins to feel impolite to disagree. Truth, stripped of its spine, becomes a popularity contest. Facts become vibes. Governance becomes branding.

Meanwhile, atrocity is rebranded as complexity. Suffering is contextualised into irrelevance. Children die on camera and are posthumously debated instead of mourned. Language becomes a shield for conscience: *conflict*, *operations*, *collateral*. Blood is edited out of the sentence. Morality is reframed as bias. Silence becomes the respectable position.

This is not confusion. It is **engineering**.

Institutions once tasked with guarding truth now behave like PR firms for power. They don't ask what is real; they ask what is *useful*. The Church mastered this long ago. Galileo's crime was not heliocentrism, it was disobedience. He disrupted hierarchy by proving that reality does not consult authority before existing. That lesson was learned well. Today, dissent is not burned; it is buried under noise, ridicule, and algorithmic neglect.

Truth is no longer persecuted.  
It is drowned.

What's most disturbing is not the lie itself, but how eagerly it is swallowed. People do not cling to falsehood because they are stupid, they cling to it because truth is destabilising. Truth demands re-evaluation, humility, and sometimes guilt. Lies ask nothing but loyalty. They offer belonging. They come with uniforms, chants, and talking points. They turn thinking into a team sport.

So yes, some people begin to resemble NPCs. Not because they lack souls, but because they've surrendered authorship of their inner life. They repeat opinions like prayers, defend contradictions like sacred mysteries, and react to reality only after checking whether it has been approved by their chosen authority. They are not evil. They are *deactivated*.

The system rewards this. Obedience is efficient. Predictability is profitable. Independent thought is a logistical nightmare.

And then there are the others, the ones who feel the wrongness in their bones. The ones who notice the cracks in the script. The ones who watch a parliament turn governance into worship and feel nausea instead of pride. The ones who sense that something ancient and predatory is wearing modern language and smiling too much.

These people are inconvenient.

They don't fit cleanly into ideologies. They don't clap on cue. They ask questions that have no safe answers. They experience consciousness not as a comfort, but as a burden. Once you see the machinery, you cannot unsee it. Once you recognise manipulation, even sincerity starts to look suspect.

Awareness isolates you. It turns crowds into puzzles. Celebrations into rituals. News into theatre. You start to realise that civilisation is held together less by truth than by mutually agreed illusions—and that pulling on any one thread threatens the entire costume.

This is why the system ridicules thinkers, pathologises skeptics, and exhausts the curious. A population that questions deeply cannot be governed cheaply. A mind that refuses simplification is a liability.

So the age manufactures consciousness the way factories manufacture goods: standardised, branded, emotionally pre-packaged. You are allowed outrage, but only briefly. Allowed compassion, ehh selectively. Allowed freedom—only symbolically. But never allowed sovereignty over your perception.

And yet, despite all of this, some fires refuse to go out.

Some minds remain uncolonised.

Some people would rather be uncomfortable in truth than comfortable in delusion. They walk through this era with a quiet fury, not loud enough to trend, but sharp enough to endure. They are not heroes. They are witnesses. And that may be more dangerous.

Because every system built on illusion eventually encounters someone who can see.

And seeing—real seeing—is the beginning of collapse.
