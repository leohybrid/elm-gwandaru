So imagine a universe where sexual pleasure is a one-time welcome bonus.

That's it.
First time? Fireworks.
After that? Customer service.

Yeah. Virginity is like a free trial. After you click "Start Subscription", boom, terms and conditions apply.

The doctor doesn't even say "Congratulations."
He's like, "Sir… I regret to inform you… you've already peaked."

😂

People would treat virginity like it's Bitcoin in 2011.

Parents would be sitting kids down like:
"Listen. Don't waste this on somebody who still types 'wyd' at 2 a.m."

Church would change the whole message.

Not "save yourself for marriage."
It'd be:
"Save yourself for somebody who can cook."

Because after the first time, it's not about pleasure anymore.
It's about logistics.

You're not having sex, you're keeping busy.

That's why married people stay together.
Not love.
Not loyalty.
It's like:
"Hey… you wanna… you know… do the thing?"

And the other person's like:
*sigh*
"Yeah… I ain't got nothing else planned."

💀

Dating apps would be honest as hell.

No more:
"Looking for my soulmate."

It'd be:
"Already used my good one.
Just need someone to watch Netflix and confirm I'm still attractive."

People would flex their first time stories like war veterans.

"You remember it?"

"Oh yeah.
Weather was perfect.
Music was right.
I ascended."

Someone else would be like:
"Man… I wasted mine behind a nightclub, next to a generator."

Silence.
Respectful silence.

😂

Cheating wouldn't even be emotional anymore.

You catch your partner like:
"You slept with someone else?!"

They're like:
"Relax. It don't do nothing.
It's just cardio with eye contact."

You'd be like:
"…oh.
Okay then.
Clean the dishes."

First times would need contracts.

People pulling out clipboards:
"Before we proceed,
Do you deserve this moment?"

Because once it's gone?
That's it.

After that, sex is like chewing gum with no flavor.

Still chew it.
Just… why?

And at the end of the day, philosophers would be confused as hell.

They'd be like:
"So let me get this straight…
Humanity is built around chasing a feeling…
that only happens once?"

Yeah.

Just like happiness.
Just like childhood.
Just like believing capitalism cares about you.
