Life’s messy, loud, kind of cruel — but somehow still worth the hang. ✨



Thankful, not because life is tidy or fair, but because it keeps showing up: messy, mean, glorious in tiny strokes. I am grateful for the mornings that don’t promise much and still hand me a light to hold. Grateful for the scraped knees that teach me to dance differently, for the small betrayals that sharpen honesty, for the neighbor’s laugh that lands in the exact place my chest aches. Life is a stubborn teacher with no classes scheduled,  it gives tests at 3 a.m., hands out blessings wrapped in paper bags, and demands you clap anyway. I say thank you like a curse and a benediction, because gratitude is a stubborn muscle: flex it and the world feels less like a sentence and more like a weathered map you can still read. So thank you, life; for the bad coffee, the sudden rain, the pulling-and-releasing of people, the quiet kindnesses that arrive like contraband. I wouldn’t trade the scars; they are the margins where the story lives.



again, just Thankful, just a thankful MF — because the stubborn fact of being alive is its own dangerous miracle.
