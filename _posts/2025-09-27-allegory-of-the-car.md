**(Why the Soul Keeps Driving While the Body Wants a Paint Job)**

Most people think they’re the car. They wax it, tone it, bleach the headlights, tint the windows, buy rims to match their ego’s shoes — but they forget: the purpose of a car is not to be admired in the parking lot, but to go somewhere.

The body is the chassis — a beautiful illusion of choice between red or black, coupe or SUV. It rusts, it creaks, it begs for polish, cries under the sun, whines in the rain, and still asks for compliments.

But the engine — the soul — it doesn’t care for shine. It burns in a chamber of oil and pressure, explodes in silence, feeds on fuel called willpower. It moves worlds while asking nothing but: "Where are we going?"

Most people spend lifetimes at the carwash, paying premiums for new bumpers, cosmetic surgeries, filters, new mirrors that still reflect lies. But they never pop the hood. They fear grease. They fear fire. They fear the hum of something real beneath the frame.

Your will? That’s the steering wheel. Too loose — you drift into dead ends. Too rigid — you can’t make turns life throws. You must learn to glide.

Your intuition is the side mirror — always showing you what’s behind and beside, but never what's ahead.

That’s where your vision comes in — the windshield made of fractured past, raindrops of confusion, and the occasional birdshit of regret. But wipe it clean. Keep driving.

Fuel is purpose. If you chase aesthetics, you’ll stall. If you fill yourself with envy, gossip, fear — you’ll knock, choke, and break down in the middle of nowhere.

And brakes? That’s your discipline. Sometimes the road looks clear, but if your brakes are gone, so are you.

Now here’s the funny bit — The GPS, your inner compass, was pre-installed before you even knew your name. But most override it with the voices of passengers who never took driving lessons.

Sometimes, you’ll find others on the road who honk at your silence, laugh at your dents, race you for no reason. Let them. You’ve got different fuel, a different map, a different destination.

Some cars were made for the city, others for the jungle, and a few rare ones — for the stars.

So the next time your body complains of the sun, just remind it: "The engine is literally roaring in fire, and it still wants to move."

This body is your vehicle. It wants comfort. It wants polish. It wants parking.

But your soul? It was born for the open road.

So check your oil — your emotions.
Top up your fuel — your purpose.
Align your wheels — your beliefs.

And don’t just exist. Drive.
