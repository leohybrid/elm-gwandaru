**(An African President’s Prayer)**

He does not kill with knives,
his hands are too clean for that.
He strangles with policy,
with signatures written in imported ink,
with laws sharpened like machetes
against the throats of his own people.

Factories?
He drowns them in silence,
switches off their breathing machines,
sells the carcasses to foreigners
who roast them as trophies.
Industries bleed out quietly,
their corpses stacked like statistics
in government reports no one reads.

Farmers plant hope,
he harvests despair.
Teachers light candles,
he blows out the flame.
Hospitals scream with empty shelves,
the sick rot in waiting rooms —
their deaths filed as “budget constraints.”

And the streets?
He floods them with promises
until everyone drowns.
Every pothole is a shallow grave,
every bridge is a noose,
every ballot box is a coffin
he nails shut with slogans.

They call him “Excellency,”
bow to his shadow,
polish his shoes while he walks
through the blood he never admits exists.
The courtrooms clap for his alibis,
the churches sprinkle holy water
on his well-tailored sins.
Nobody dares say murderer —
because here,
murder wears a suit.

But when he goes to bed,
does he hear it?
The breathing of the dead beneath his mattress,
the coughing of factories he starved,
the lullaby of a nation
he carved into an obituary?

And yet —
what if he too is only a tool?
Not born a butcher,
but sharpened by hands
older than the soil.
Groomed like every killer in a palace,
trained to serve the faceless gods
who sip oil and debt,
who laugh in currencies,
who make corpses into contracts.

Perhaps he is just another child soldier
of empire,
wearing the uniform of a president,
but chained by unseen generals.
Perhaps the killer is also the killed —
a man strangled by power,
even as he strangles us all.
