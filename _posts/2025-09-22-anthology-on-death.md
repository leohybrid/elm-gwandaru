A swirling storm of dark purples and cosmic blacks, threaded with crimson smoke. Ornate African floral motifs in gold, emerald, and sapphire frame a cloaked silhouette, with skeletal hands reaching through lightning veins. A gothic tapestry woven with baroque embroidery and golden threads, this piece explores the dance of mortality.
