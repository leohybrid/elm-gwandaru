# ACT 1: **Velvet Knuckles \& Razor Tongues**



I don’t write for applause.

I don’t write for academia with their clean collars and sterile citations.

I write for the ghosts that hover in alleyways,

for the hustlers who found God in a pawn shop,

for the philosophers who couldn’t afford rent

but paid their dues in cigarette smoke and stubbornness.



This blog ain’t a blog, or is it? 

it’s a trap house for ideas.

Every post is contraband,

every sentence a brick of uncut thought,

smuggled past the border patrol of good manners and middle-class morality.

I lace metaphors with attitude,

stack punchlines on paradox,

and if you read too slow, you’ll get robbed by the rhythm.



You want to call it poetry? Fine.

You want to call it madness? Better.

I call it survival.

Because in a world where everything’s been sold back to us;

our style, our slang, our soul, our silence—

writing is the last free hustle left.



Picture this: Iceberg Slim traded his Cadillac for a library card,

and now he’s ghostwriting for a rebel monk

who reads Nietzsche in a sneaker shop.

That’s me.

That’s the energy.

Every line a hustle, every rhyme a testimony,

every thought dipped in sarcasm

and wrapped in the velvet of “don’t test me.”



I write like I’m conjuring spells in a police report,

like I’m painting halos on devils in Sharpie,

like I’m turning philosophy into street food—

cheap, greasy, filling, unforgettable.

You don’t eat my words;

my words eat you.



This blog ain’t safe.

It ain’t holy.

It’s magical the way chaos is magical;

like lightning in a mason jar,

like a burning bush that only smokes Kush,

like scripture rewritten in spray paint.



So if you’re looking for peace, log out.

If you’re looking for clarity, scroll elsewhere.

But if you want the truth raw,

with the bite of irony and the flavor of rebellion;

sit down, light something,

and let me show you how dangerous language can get

when it’s finally free.
