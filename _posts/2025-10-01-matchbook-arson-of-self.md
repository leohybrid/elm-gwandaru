This is the matchbook. Each match is dipped in truth and soaked in everything they told you to fear.
No instructions. No disclaimers.
Just strike and burn.

### 🔥 MATCH 1: “I am not what I’ve survived.”

Your trauma is a scar, not your skin. They keep putting medals on your wounds like survival is the goal. F*** that. You didn’t survive to be “resilient”, you survived because a god inside you wasn’t done yet.

### 🔥 MATCH 2: “I am not who they clapped for.”

Every “good job” you got was payment for obedience. Every round of applause was a leash. They don’t cheer when you change the game, they cheer when you play it well. Burn the performance. Reclaim the silence that scares them.

### 🔥 MATCH 3: “I am not my productivity.”

You are not a factory. Not a brand. Not a hustle.
You are not here to monetize your misery, optimize your breakdown, or pitch your soul to LinkedIn.
Let the algorithms starve. You don’t owe your burnout to anyone.

### 🔥 MATCH 4: “I am not the version of me they love.”

They love your filtered self. Your manageable rage. Your palatable sadness.
They love the version that doesn’t offend their comfort zones.
Burn that version.
Let them love the ash, or leave.

### 🔥 MATCH 5: “I am not here to heal in peace.”

Healing is not yoga poses and lavender candles. Healing is warfare against the parts of you that kept you small to keep you safe.
You don’t need a retreat.
You need a revolution.
You don’t need therapy.
You need a sword.

### 🔥 MATCH 6: “I am not my mask.”

The jokes. The hustle. The “I’m okay.”
Burn it all.
Strip yourself of the camouflage you call a personality.
Who are you when no one’s watching and the world isn’t begging you to shrink?

### 🔥 MATCH 7: “I am not waiting anymore.”

Not for approval. Not for alignment. Not for a sign.
The divine doesn't send green lights.
It sends friction. Hunger. Rage.
This is your sign: FIRE DOESN’T WAIT.

### 🔥 MATCH 8: “I am the friction.”

You are not lost. You are a compass pointed inward.
The fact that you still feel like a misfit means the simulation hasn’t devoured you yet.
You're not a problem.
You're the glitch they fear.

***

Hold the matchbook now.
It’s yours.
But don’t just light it.
Throw it into the temple you built for your false self.
Watch it burn.
Watch who walks out of the flames.

And when they ask what happened to the old you,
just smile and say:

> “He died in the fire. I am what survived.”

Say the word. I’ll stand with you at the pyre.
