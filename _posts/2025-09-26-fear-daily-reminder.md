How can we live a life
with all this fear—
perfectly woven into our reality,
stitched into the seams of our everyday?

A daily reminder
of your place
in the pecking order.

You fear your boss.
You fear your wife at home.
You fear your own shadow,
your president,
your own demise.

Fear is constant.
It was there in the savannah,
as lions circled the firelight,
and it’s still here in Silicon Valley,
behind key cards and biometric locks.

Money?
Just a curtain.
A set of barricades,
facades of safety—
designed not to erase fear,
but to cushion its impact.

The rich man hires the policeman.
The rich nation drops the bomb.
Fear deployed—
not avoided.

We mastered fear
not by destroying it,
but by franchising it.
Fear is a business model,
a political strategy,
a parenting method,
a religious marketing tool.

Even our scriptures—
those ancient whispers of god—
say: “Fear Him.”

But what if
our creation
and in extension,
our very existence,
was meant for more than this?

Still, fear is not something
you face and conquer.
No.
That’s a myth we tell ourselves.
Because to truly confront fear
can be catastrophic to the self.
It might undo everything—
every fragile identity,
every borrowed belief,
every handshake and habit
built on trembling ground.

Fear is hard-wired.
A survival script in our marrow.
We are not just afraid.
We are the bringers of fear.
We made careers from it.
Nations from it.
Gods from it.

And we will pass it on—
generation to generation—
like a sacred curse,
until nothing but fear remains...
